Advanced Data Analytics Lessons

ðŸ”¹ Lesson 1: Handling Missing Data
==================================
Summary:
Missing values are common in real-world datasets.
Drop missing values (if <5% of data)
Impute values using mean/median/mode
Forward/Backward fill for time-series data

Example:
In a hospital dataset, missing patient age can be replaced with the median age of patients.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 2: Outlier Detection
============================
Summary:
Outliers = values far from the rest, may skew analysis.
Use IQR (Interquartile Range)
Use Z-score method
Visualize with boxplots

Example:
In salary data, one employee earning â‚¹50 lakhs while most earn â‚¹3â€“5 lakhs is an outlier.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 3: Introduction to SQL for Analysts
==========================================
Summary:
SQL is the core tool for querying structured data.
SELECT â€“ extract data
WHERE â€“ filter rows
ORDER BY â€“ sort data

Example:
Find customers who spent more than â‚¹5000:

SELECT customer_name, total_spent
FROM sales
WHERE total_spent > 5000;


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 4: Joins in SQL
========================
Summary:
Joins combine multiple tables for richer insights.
INNER JOIN â€“ only matching rows
LEFT JOIN â€“ all rows from left, matched from right
RIGHT JOIN â€“ opposite of LEFT
FULL JOIN â€“ all rows from both

Example:
Joining customers and orders tables to see who ordered what.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 5: Mini Case Study â€“ Customer Purchase Analysis
=====================================================
Summary:
Using cleaning + SQL queries + visualization to analyze purchases:
Clean missing values in customer data
Detect outliers in purchase amounts
Use SQL to join orders + customers
Build a bar chart of top 10 customers by spending

Example:
A retail store found its top 10% of customers contributed 60% of revenue.
